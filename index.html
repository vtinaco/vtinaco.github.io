    <h1>My First MCC Win!</h1>
    <img src="images/mcc-win.png" alt="Minecraft Championship tester win" />
    <p>
        On this day, I tested for
        <a href="https://mcchampionship.fandom.com/wiki/MC_Championship_21">MCC 21</a
      >
      and was able to make it to dodgebolt in second place and win. This was my
      second full test so it's insane that I actually won. When I first became a
      tester, I was sure that I wouldn't win for a long while since many other
      people who have been testers for longer also hadn't won yet. In my first
      full test, I place around 33rd, in this test I placed around 13th. Pretty
      good jump in placement if you ask me.
